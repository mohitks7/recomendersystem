# recommendersystem
Two ways by which a recommeder system works:
1) Content based: It generally means "show me more of the same of what I've liked before". Like if a person watches a movie in belonging to comedy genre then he/she is more likely to recieve similar recommendations.

2) Collaborative filtering: This generally says "Tell me what's popular among my neighbours, I also might like it". Collaborative filtering finds similar groups of users, and provide recommendations based on similar tastes within that group.
